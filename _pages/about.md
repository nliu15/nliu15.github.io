I am a PhD student in the [Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/) and the [Mathematical Institute for Data Science](https://www.minds.jhu.edu/) at Johns Hopkins University, where I'm fortunate to be advised by Professor [Benjamin Grimmer](https://www.ams.jhu.edu/~grimmer/). I obtained master's degree of applied math and statistics in Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics and master's degree of math in [Department of Math](https://mathematics.jhu.edu/) from Johns Hopkins University. Before that I obtained my Bachelor degree of Human Resource Management from Renmin University of China.

I will be on the 2023-2024 job market.


Research area
------
My current research focuses on the design and analysis of algorithms for continuous optimization problems beyond the areas where classical theory applies. I am interested in the intersection of data science, stochastic optimization and continuous optimization.
